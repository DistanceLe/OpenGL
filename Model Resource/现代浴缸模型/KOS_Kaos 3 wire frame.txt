Kos, Kaos 3 wire frame
Ludovica + Roberto Palomba

The free-standing whirlpool bathtub designed for placement in the centre of the room can be equipped with blower(with warm-air massage jets) and with the Idrocolore®colour therapy system. It is available also in the version buil-in and semi built-in. The perimetral panels once needed to conceal the working parts and plumbing have been done away with on this large acrylic tub, which is held up simply on two steel legs. Drainage is through the floor, but thanks to a brand-new engineering approach the drain unit has been enclosed under the edge of the tub, creating the impression of a large suspended bath. Kaos can be also set into the floor and can be equipped with whirlpool, blower and Idrocolore®.
